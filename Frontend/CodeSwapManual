## Overview
Welcome to the Manifest Challenge! Complete the challenges stated below. Good luck!

## Codebase Overview 
- **App Name:** Manifest App
- **Primary Functionality:** Allow users to create vision boards
- **Key Technologies:** React, Node.js, Express, MongoDB

## Objectives 
- Improve a feature and fix an issue.

## Tasks 
1. **Add some form of pagination to the images**
- When a user enters a key word for example, New York, the app should display only 15 images relating to New York at a time from each API before pagination hits and then the next 10 and so on. But the total output should be of 60 images (30 images from Unsplash API and 30 images from Pexels API). So in essence, there should be 4 hits to the endpoints since there is a total of 60 images / 15 images.
- Keep in mind that the API limit is 50 calls per hour and 200 calls per hour for Unsplash and Pexels, respectively. 

2. **Debug Firebase Issue**
- I have already implemented Firebase authentication for user sign-in and sign-up. However, everytime a push my code to Github, I get an email with this error: Deploy to Firebase Hosting on merge: All jobs have failed.
- Please identify what the error is and fix the issue in the code. 

## Important Notes
- APIs: Unsplash API and Pexels API
