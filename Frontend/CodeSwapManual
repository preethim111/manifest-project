## Overview
Welcome to the Manifest Challenge! Complete the challenges stated below. Good luck!

## Codebase Overview 
- **App Name:** Manifest App
- **Primary Functionality:** Allow users to create vision boards
- **Key Technologies:** React, Node.js, Express, MongoDB

## Objectives 
- Fix issues.

## Tasks 
1. **Add the previewImage to my backend**
- When a user creates a vision board, they give a title, description, and a thumbnail/preview image. When they hit the "Create" Button, these three 
attributes should be stored in the boards database. I have already started the board schema in boardModel.js and have saved the title and description
but not the image. Please finish the code to succesfully save all three attributes of the board in the database. 

2. **Debug Firebase Issue**
- I have already implemented Firebase authentication for user sign-in and sign-up. However, everytime a push my code to Github, I get an email with this error: Deploy to Firebase Hosting on merge: All jobs have failed.
- Please identify what the error is and fix the issue in the code.
